Codes for optimizing oral contraceptive timing

This model was developed using the Gavina et al. model as the baseline, as described in the manuscript: Optimizing oral contraceptive timing: Morning intake reduces doses and enhances efficacy

To use the model: 

1. Navigate to the folder src/julia_codes, then open the folder models and run the file menstrual_model.jl to perform simulations

2. Navigate to the folder src/julia_codes, then run the file run_optimization_clock.sh to perform optimization for dosing times from 1:00 to 24:00.


--------------------------------------------

Code of Gavina et al. model of hormonal contraception is updated to investigate the role of dosing time in contraceptive efficacy.

The Gavina et al. model (https://github.com/3r3nd/menstrual-cycle-project) was originally developed by modifying the Margolskee et al. model (Margolskee, A. and Selgrade, J.F., 2011. Dynamics and bifurcation of a model for hormonal control of the menstrual cycle with inhibin delay. Mathematical Biosciences, 234(2), pp.95-107) to depict exogenous progesteroneâ€™s contraceptive effect.
